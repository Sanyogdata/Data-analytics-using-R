#This is time series analysis for sales data. We used decomposition method here.

#We pull up sales data using read.csv and assign tsdata to Ts.csv
tsdata <- read.csv("Ts.csv")

Now we are applying time series function that is available in base r package. 
#Ts - Time series function
# Start = 2008 1st quater
#end - 2011 4th quater
#Frequency - no of quaters in an year
# tsdata$Sales Selecting sales from tsdata

myts <- ts(tsdata$Sales,start = c(2008,1),end = c(2011,4), frequency = 4)
# We plot myts to see seasonality type
plot(myts)
# By looking graph we know that seasonality is multiplicative in this case

# Now we use decompose function to calculate seasonality index for the data and plot the graph

plot(decompose(myts, type = c("multiplicative")))\

# there is another function stl() to calculate seasonality index

fit <- stl(myts,s.window = "period")

# We require forecast package to predict future values
libary(forecast)
fit <- ets(myts) 
plot(fit)
# Accuracy function to calculate MAPE(Mean absolute percentage error)
accuracy(fit$fitted,myts)
#Forecast function to prediict future values . 4 is the no of quaters for which we want new predicted values
forecast(fit,4)
plot(forecast(fit,4))
summary(fit)
